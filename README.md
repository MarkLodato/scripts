## Useful scripts

This is a collection of scripts that I find useful but are not worthy of having
their own repository each.

### 256colors

Prints out the xterm 256 color chart.

### git-recent-branches

Lists branches and their ages, sorted by last commit timestamp.

<pre>
$ git recent-branches
  feature                        3 weeks ago
  other-branch                   4 days ago
* <span style="color: #00cd00">master                         8 minutes ago</span>
</pre>
